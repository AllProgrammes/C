#include <stdio.h> //header file//
int main()         // could have been written void main but idk why my vscode gives error when writing void //
{
    printf("HELLO WORLD"); //';' is called terminator (it is used to end the line or say end of line )
    return 0;              // it removes the garbage value left after compilation//
