  /*

  Explainations :-

  1. sizeof(variable_name) -> When sizeof() is used with the data types such as int, float, charâ€¦ etc it simply returns the amount of memory is allocated to that data types.

  2. \n is used to move the cursor to a new line

  3. %d is used for integer ,
     %f is used for float ,
     %lf is used for double ,
     %c is used for character.
